# From ES5 to ES6
ECMAScript is a programming language specification first developed by Netscape in 1995.  It is the specification that defines how Javascript should function as a language.  It has changed significantly since then, and continues to evolve today.  The community is currently in a transition from ES5 to the new, and greatly improved ES6, also known as ES2015.  It takes a few years for all of the web browsers to fully support a new language specification, which can add some interesting challenges to us as programmers if we are writing Javascript that needs to run in our users browsers, where we have little to no control over when they upgrade to the latest version that supports ES6.

Up to this point in the class, we've been working with ES5 to avoid these issues, because it is widely supported, and avoids the issue completely.  But, this is class is about your future as a web developer, and the future is ES6, so we're going to turn our focus to the new specification.  The next few sections of the course are focused on running Javascript on the server, where we as developers have more control over the environment our code runs in.  This is great news because it means that we can use a modern version of Node.js which has great support for the ES6 syntax.  As long as we are running a version of Node greater than 6.5, we're good to go.  

When it comes to ES6 vs. ES5, the improvements are substantial enough that developers are motivated to use it, even for code running in web browsers, and have developed tools to allow them to do so.  We'll be covering these tools, and making use of them when we're done looking at server side Javascript, and shift our attention back to React.  Stay tuned!

## Benefits of ES2015 / ES6
So why is ES6 so important?  Why are we committing to learn yet another language syntax when there is already so much ground that needs to be covered?  As already mentioned, it is the new standard, and will become ubiquitous over the next 2 year, so its worth learning now to stay ahead of that wave, but there is more.  ES6 fixes a lot of the long standing problems that existed in Javascript beforehand, helping us write less buggy code that is more concise and easier to read at the same time.  That's a lot of win.

The 4 major improvements in ES6 that we'll look into are:
- Block Scope
- Classes
- Destructured Literals
- Text Interpolation
