# Flux Actions
![Flux Actions](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-site/curriculum/React/flux-actions.jpeg)

Flux apps are very stable.  Each part of the flux circle is responsible for its own part.  Each part is responsible for only its own part, and only has to worry about listening to the part before it in the chain.  When apps grow to have multiple stores, and thousands of actions, a Flux app still remains stable and easy for us to reason about as developers.
