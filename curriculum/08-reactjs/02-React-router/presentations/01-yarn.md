# Yarn

Yarn is a package manager, like NPM, released by Facebook.  It works very similarly to NPM, and is the package manager that create-react-app uses.  You use it in place of NPM completely.

## Commands

| NPM | Yarn |
|-----| -----|
| npm install | yarn |
| npm install --save <name> | yarn add <name> |

The two most important commands we'll need to use with yarn are to install packages.  Listed above are the NPM commands you are already familiar with, and the Yarn equivalents.
