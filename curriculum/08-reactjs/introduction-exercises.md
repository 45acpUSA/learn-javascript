#Exercises

We've just scratched the surface of all that React has to offer us as
developers, but there are already a lot of the core concepts that you are
familiar with.  Most importantly, we've learned how to work with
components, and use components together to build more complex components.

1. Create a new reactjs app using create-react-app that contains several
   components to build a page about a sport or activity that you enjoy.

2. Create a new reactjs app about your favorite places to eat lunch.  Use
   state to build an array of restaurants.  
   - attributes for each restaurant
     - name
     - prices: low, mid, expensive
     - description
     - distance from LEARN
