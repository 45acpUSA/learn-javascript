# Todo List Models

## Challenge

In this challenge, we are going to model a set of todo lists.  A list has many todo items.  Each todo item can be set to 'completed'.

* Note: This challenge is about modeling data.  You don't need to setup a user interface for your Todo Lists just yet.  We'll be doing that tomorrow!

## Schema

Using Sequelize-CLI, create a new application that models the following db schema,and sets up the proper migrations.  Be sure to include a sample application demonstrating (with ```console.log()```) that your models work.


###Stretch 1:

Repeat the same exercise, using Test Driven Development

###Stretch 2:

Read about the other types of associations here:
[Sequelize Docs](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/en/v3/docs/associations/)

And using TDD, add other tables and associations to your application.
