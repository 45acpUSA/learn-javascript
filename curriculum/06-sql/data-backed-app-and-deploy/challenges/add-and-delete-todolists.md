# Add and Delete TodoLists

For this challenge, we're going to continue to work on the Todo List application.  We've added the ability to add new todos to a todo list, and to remove them, but we don't yet have the ability to add and remove todo lists themselves.  Your task is to add the controls and routes to manage todo lists.

## Stories
As a user, I want to be able to add new Todo Lists so I can manage the things I need to do.
As a user, I want to be able to remove Todo Lists that I have completed, or am no longer working on.

> Hint:  Remember that deletes of Todo Lists cascade, so deleting a List will also delete all of the associated todos.  This is exactly what we want.

## Starting point
[Example Repo](https://github.com/notch8/learn-javascript-examples/tree/master/06-sql/express-full-stack)

Clone the examples repository to pick up where we left off in the presentations, or continue on with your own application if you've been following along with the presentation.

**Note:** If you clone the example repo, remember to run ```npm install``` in side the appliction directory to get all the required NPM modules installed

## Hints

Try and complete this task on your own.  If you do get stuck, and want to see how we solved these two stories, you can look at a working example [here](https://github.com/notch8/learn-javascript-examples/tree/06-sql_express-full-stack_add-remove-todo-lists/06-sql/express-full-stack).
