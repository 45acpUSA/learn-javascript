In this challenge, we are going to do some research about NPM modules and add a logging solution for a sample application based on 3rd party software

## Epic

The business requires that each page view is logged, including a time stamp of when the server processed the request.

## Story
As the business owner, I want to see a log of all web traffic to the site

## Story
As the business owner, I want to know when the requests were processed by the server

## Story (stretch)
As the business owner, I want to know how long it took for the server to process the request

Hint:  Take advantage of the fact that middleware is invoked when a request is on its way down, and again on the way back up.
