##Eloquentjavascript

- higher order functions
  - functions that operate on functions
  - allow us to write code that describes what we want to do, instead of how we
    want to do it

- functional programming is:
  - pure functions
  - avoids shared state, mutable data, and side-effects
  - declarative

- pure functions
  - given the same inputs, always returns same output
  - has no side-effects

- function composition
  - combine two or more functions to produce a new function

- Avoid shared state
  - Shared state is: any variable, object, or memory space that exists in a
    shared scope
  - use immutable data structures and pure calculations to derive new data from
    existing data
  - race condition example

- Declarative vs. Imperative
  - program logic is expressed without explicitly describing the flow control
  - what vs how
