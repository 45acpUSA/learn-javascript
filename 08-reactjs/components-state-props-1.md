6. A closer look at components
  - Instructor led
  - refactor Tic-Tac-Toe to make better use of components
  - state
  - props
  - component life cycle
    - constructor
    - defined
    - mounted
    - rendered
    - destroyed

- Pure vs. Impure Components
  - pure
    - building a stateless component
    - no side effects
    - given the same inputs, it will always render exactly the same thing
